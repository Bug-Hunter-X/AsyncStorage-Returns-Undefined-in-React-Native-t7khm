# AsyncStorage Undefined Bug in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications when using AsyncStorage.  The issue arises from incorrectly handling the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage, leading to undefined values being accessed.

## Bug Description

Attempting to access data from AsyncStorage before the asynchronous operation completes results in an undefined value. This can cause unexpected behavior in components, such as crashes or rendering errors.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `then` or `async/await` methods to properly handle the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage.  This ensures that data is accessed only after the asynchronous operation has successfully completed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run the application using the React Native CLI.
4. Observe the console for errors related to undefined values.

## How to Solve

1. Review the `bugSolution.js` file for the corrected implementation.
2. Note the use of `.then()` or `async/await` to ensure the data is accessed only after it has been loaded.

## Additional Notes

- Always remember that AsyncStorage is asynchronous, and you must handle its asynchronous nature appropriately.
- Consider using alternative data storage mechanisms, like Redux or Context API, for managing more complex application states.
